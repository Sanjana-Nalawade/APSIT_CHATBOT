Civil Engineering:
This department has the following laboratories:Engineering geology lab,Soil mechanics lab,Transportation lab,Environmental engineering lab,Concrete technology lab,Building material and construction lab,Strength of materials lab (shared with the department of mechanical engineering).






Applied Sciences and Humanities:
Students at the applied chemistry laboratory of the college,The department of applied sciences and humanities did not offer any degrees of its own,It supported the curriculum of other departments by offering courses in the following disciplines:
Applied mathematics (first 4 or 5 semesters in each branch),Applied physics (first 2 semesters),Applied chemistry (first 2 semesters),Communication skills (second semester),Presentation and communication techniques (third semester of each branch),Environmental studies (fifth semester of each branch except civil engineering).
Students at the language laboratory (for the subjects of "communication skills" and "presentation & communication techniques"),In the 4-year Bachelor of Engineering curriculum of the University of Mumbai, the first year (i.e., the first 2 semesters) is common for all engineering majors,Thus, first-year students of the Parshvanath College of Engineering were managed by the department of applied sciences and humanities, rather than the departments 
of the engineering branches that they had taken admission in.
The department of applied sciences and humanities has the following laboratories:[11]
Applied Chemistry Lab,Applied Physics Lab,Computer Programming Lab,Engineering Mechanics Lab,Language Lab (for the subjects of communication skills and presentation & communication techniques),Basic Electrical & Electronics Engineering Lab,
Sci Lab (for Scilab software taught in applied mathematics).




Library:
